<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femoral Stems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementless</li><li>Cemented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Femoral stems are devices used in hip replacement surgeries to provide stability and support to the artificial hip joint. There are two main types of femoral stems in the market: cementless and cemented. Cementless femoral stems are designed to grow into the bone for stability without the need for bone cement, while cemented femoral stems are fixed in place using bone cement. Both types have their own advantages and limitations, and the choice between them depends on factors such as patient age, bone quality, and surgeon preference.</p></p>
