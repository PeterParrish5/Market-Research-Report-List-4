<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Heart Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li><li>Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artificial Heart Stent market comprises three main types: Bare-metal Stents (BMS) are metal stents that provide structural support to keep the artery open after surgery. Drug-eluting Stents (DES) are coated with medication to prevent cell proliferation and reduce the risk of restenosis. Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) market involves stents made of biodegradable materials that slowly dissolve in the body over time, reducing long-term complications. These different types offer varying benefits and considerations for patients needing coronary artery stents.</p></p>
