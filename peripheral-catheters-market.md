<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PIVC</li><li>Midline Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral Intravenous Catheters (PIVC) are short catheters inserted into a peripheral vein for short-term use. They are commonly used for administering medications, fluids, and blood products. Midline Catheters are longer catheters that are inserted into a peripheral vein but advance further into the venous system, allowing for a longer dwell time. They are suitable for patients requiring medium-term vascular access for intravenous therapy. Both types of catheters play a crucial role in providing necessary medical treatments through intravenous administration in healthcare settings.</p></p>
