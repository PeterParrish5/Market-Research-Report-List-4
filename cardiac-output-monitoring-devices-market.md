<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Output Monitoring Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive</li><li>Minimally Invasive</li><li>Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Output Monitoring Devices market is segmented into three types based on the level of invasiveness: Non-invasive, Minimally Invasive, and Invasive. Non-invasive methods like bioimpedance and echocardiography do not require any penetration of the skin, making them safer and more comfortable for patients. Minimally Invasive techniques involve inserting a catheter into a blood vessel near the heart, providing more accurate measurements without major surgery. Invasive methods involve directly measuring cardiac output through catheterization, providing the most precise data but also carrying higher risks.</p></p>
