<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Computer-Aided Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Structure Based Drug</li><li>Ligand Based Drug</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Structure-based drug design involves using information about the three-dimensional structure of a target protein to design drugs that specifically bind to and inhibit its activity. This approach relies on computer modeling and simulation to predict how a potential drug compound will interact with the target protein. Ligand-based drug design, on the other hand, involves designing drugs based on the structure of a known ligand that binds to the target protein. This approach focuses on optimizing the chemical structure of the drug to enhance its binding affinity and potency.</p></p>
