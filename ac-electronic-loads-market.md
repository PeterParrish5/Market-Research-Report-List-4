<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Electronic Loads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Loads</li><li>Non-Linear Loads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC electronic loads are categorized into two main types: linear loads and non-linear loads. Linear loads draw a constant amount of current, creating a linear relationship between voltage and current. These are commonly used in precision applications where stability and accuracy are crucial. Non-linear loads, on the other hand, draw current in a non-linear manner, causing distortion in the voltage waveform. These are commonly used in industries where variable loads are required, such as in power electronics testing and electromagnetic device testing.</p></p>
