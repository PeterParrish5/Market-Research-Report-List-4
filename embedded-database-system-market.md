<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embedded Database System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Premise</li><li>Cloud-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Embedded database systems are available in two main market types: On-Premise and Cloud-Based. On-Premise solutions require the database to be hosted locally on the user's own servers, providing greater control and security but requiring more maintenance. Cloud-Based solutions, on the other hand, host the database on remote servers accessed through the internet, offering greater flexibility and scalability but potentially raising concerns about data security and compliance. Both options have their own advantages and limitations, catering to different preferences and requirements of businesses.</p></p>
