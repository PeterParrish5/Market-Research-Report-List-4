<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spray Water Control Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-Way Type</li><li>3-Way Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spray water control valves are typically categorized into two main types: 2-way and 3-way. The 2-way type of valve controls the flow of water in a straight path, either allowing the water to pass through or shutting it off completely. On the other hand, the 3-way valve allows the water flow to be directed in three different directions, providing more flexibility in controlling the flow of water. These market types cater to different needs and applications in various water control systems.</p></p>
