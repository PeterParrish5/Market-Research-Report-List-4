<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Linear Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting</li><li>Double-Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydraulic Linear Actuators play a vital role in various industries with two main types - single-acting and double-acting. Single-acting actuators use hydraulic pressure to extend the cylinder in one direction only, relying on an external force (such as a spring) to retract it. On the other hand, double-acting actuators use hydraulic pressure to extend and retract the cylinder, making them more versatile and suitable for applications requiring precise control over the motion. Both types offer different benefits and are chosen based on specific requirements.</p></p>
