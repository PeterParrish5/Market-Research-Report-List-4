<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power Factor Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Power Factor Controllers</li><li>Passive Power Factor Controllers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active Power Factor Controllers are devices used to actively correct and maintain power factor by continuously measuring and adjusting the amount of reactive power consumed. They are more efficient and precise compared to passive controllers, making them ideal for industrial and commercial applications. </p><p>Passive Power Factor Controllers, on the other hand, are simpler devices that are only capable of correcting power factor within a fixed range. They are cost-effective but less efficient than active controllers and are commonly used in residential and small-scale applications.</p></p>
