<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertebral Compression Fracture Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Kyphoplasty Devices</li><li>Vertebroplasty Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertebral compression fracture devices are used to treat fractures in the spinal vertebrae, which are common in conditions like osteoporosis. There are two main types of devices in the market - balloon kyphoplasty devices and vertebroplasty devices. Balloon kyphoplasty involves inflating a balloon in the vertebrae to create space before injecting bone cement, while vertebroplasty involves directly injecting bone cement into the fractured vertebrae. Both devices aim to stabilize the fracture, relieve pain, and restore vertebral height and alignment.</p></p>
