<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reverse Phase Columns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-packed Columns-Gas Chromatography (Gc) Systems</li><li>Empty Columns-Gas Chromatography (Gc) Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reverse Phase Columns Market:</p><p>Reverse phase columns are a type of chromatography column used in the separation of compounds based on their hydrophobicity. Pre-packed columns refer to columns that come pre-filled with the stationary phase, making them convenient for users. Gas Chromatography (GC) Systems utilize reverse phase columns for separating volatile compounds. On the other hand, empty columns in GC systems require users to pack their own stationary phase, providing more flexibility in column customization and maintenance. Both pre-packed and empty columns play a crucial role in the efficient separation of compounds in GC systems.</p></p>
