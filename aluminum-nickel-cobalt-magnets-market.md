<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum-Nickel-Cobalt Magnets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Type</li><li>Sintered Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aluminum-Nickel-Cobalt magnets are available in two main types: cast and sintered. Cast magnets are produced through a casting process, resulting in a relatively lower magnetic performance but a lower cost. Sintered magnets, on the other hand, are manufactured through a powder metallurgy process, offering higher magnetic performance and better dimensional accuracy. The sintered type is generally more expensive compared to the cast type due to its advanced production method and superior magnetic properties. Both types cater to different market demands based on cost and performance requirements.</p></p>
