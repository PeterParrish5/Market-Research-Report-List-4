<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ECMO Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ECMO devices are categorized into two main types: VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO and VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO. VA ECMO provides both cardiac and respiratory support by removing oxygen-poor blood from a vein, saturating it with oxygen, and then returning it to an artery. VV ECMO, on the other hand, only provides respiratory support by removing oxygen-poor blood from a vein, oxygenating it, and returning it to the same vein. Both types of ECMO devices play a crucial role in supporting patients with severe cardiac and respiratory failure.</p></p>
