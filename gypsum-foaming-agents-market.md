<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gypsum Foaming Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stable Foaming Agents</li><li>Unstable Foaming Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gypsum foaming agents can be categorized into two main types: stable foaming agents and unstable foaming agents. Stable foaming agents are those that maintain their foam-forming properties over an extended period of time, providing consistent and reliable foaming results. On the other hand, unstable foaming agents are less reliable and may lose their foaming ability quickly. The choice between stable and unstable foaming agents depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired foam properties.</p></p>
