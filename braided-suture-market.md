<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Braided Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Braided Suture</li><li>Non-absorbable Braided Suture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Braided sutures are divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable braided sutures are made from materials that break down in the body over time, eliminating the need for removal after healing. Non-absorbable braided sutures, on the other hand, are made from materials that do not break down and require removal by a healthcare provider once the wound has healed. Both types of braided sutures provide strong and durable closure for surgical incisions and wounds.</p></p>
