<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Aviation Turbofan Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Bypass Turbofan Engines</li><li>Low-Bypass Turbofan Engines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial Aviation Turbofan Engines Market includes two main types: High-Bypass Turbofan Engines and Low-Bypass Turbofan Engines. High-Bypass Turbofan Engines are designed with a large fan diameter compared to the core engine, resulting in a higher bypass ratio for increased fuel efficiency and reduced noise. On the other hand, Low-Bypass Turbofan Engines have a smaller fan diameter, generating less bypass air and offering higher thrust-to-weight ratio. Both types cater to different segments within the aviation industry, meeting varying performance requirements and customer preferences.</p></p>
