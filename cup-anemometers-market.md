<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cup Anemometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Four-Cup</li><li>Three-Cup</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cup anemometers are devices used to measure wind speed. They come in two main types - four-cup and three-cup anemometers. Four-cup anemometers are considered more accurate as they provide a more stable measurement of wind speed, while three-cup anemometers are simpler in design and are generally less expensive. Both types work on the principle that wind causes the cups to rotate, with the speed of rotation corresponding to the wind speed.</p></p>
