<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Drug Delivery Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biodegradable</li><li>Non-Biodegradable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implantable drug delivery systems can be categorized into biodegradable and non-biodegradable types. Biodegradable systems gradually degrade over time and are absorbed by the body, eliminating the need for removal after the drug is delivered. Non-biodegradable systems remain in the body indefinitely and may require surgical removal once the drug has been released. Both types offer controlled and targeted drug delivery, providing a more efficient and convenient way to administer medication for various medical conditions.</p></p>
